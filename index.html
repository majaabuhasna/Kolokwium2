    <p class="paragraph1">Artificial intelligence (AI) is the capability of computational systems to perform tasks
    typically associated with human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving,
    perception, and decision-making. It is a field of research in computer science that develops
    and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use
    learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.
    High-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search);
    recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); virtual assistants
    (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools
    (e.g., language models and AI art); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go).
    However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: "A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general
    applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough
    it's not labeled AI anymore."

            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken into subproblems.
            These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display.
            The traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research.</p>

            <h2>Ethics</h2>
            <p>AI has potential benefits and potential risks. AI may be able to advance science and find solutions
            for serious problems: Demis Hassabis of DeepMind hopes to "solve intelligence, and then use that to
            solve everything else". However, as the use of AI has become widespread, several unintended consequences
            and risks have been identified.</p>
